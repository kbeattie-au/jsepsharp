## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit an issue with the tag `security` when reporting security vulnerabilities. Any PRs that are created should additionally use the tag `security` and reference the issue ticket, if one exists. Depending on the severity, the problem may be addressed immediately or when time permits. This is a personal project. Watch issues and pull requests for updates on whether a vulnerability was accepted or declined, along with when accepted vulnerabilities receive fixes. Security-specific releases will typically be done by incrementing the revision portion of the version number.
